Pseudocode Practice Problems

Problem 1) A function that returns the sum of two numbers.
## Casual ##
Given two numbers, return the sum of number1 and number2

## Formal ##
SET output = number1 + number2
PRINT output

Problem 2) A function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together.
## Casual ##
Given a collection of strings.

Create an empty initial string
Iterate through the collection of strings one by one.
 - Concat the current string to the initial string

After iterating through collection, return initial string

## Formal ##
SET output = empty string
SET iterator = 0
WHILE iterator < length of collection
  SET output = output + string within collection at space "iterator"
  iterator++

RETURN output

Problem 3) A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element. For instance:
## Casual ##
Given a collection of numbers
Create an empty collection

Iterate through original collection
 - If the current index is even or zero
  - append current value at index to empty collection
 - Otherwise, continue to next value

Return empty collection

## Formal ##
SET output = empty array
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < length of collection
  IF iterator modulus 2 is equal to 0
    append current value to output

  iterator++

RETURN output

Problem 4) A function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string. 
For instance, if the given character is 'x' and the string is 'axbxcdxex', the function should return 6 (the index of the 3rd 'x').
If the given character does not occur at least 3 times, return null.

## Casual ##
Given a string of characters and a starting character

Intialize counter to 0

Iterate through string one character at a time
  - If current character is equal to given character
    - Increment counter by one
    - If counter is equal to three
      - Return current index

If you complete loop, return null

## Formal ##
SET counter = 0
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < length of given string
  IF current character == given character
    counter++
    IF counter == 3
      RETURN interator
  interator++

RETURN null


Problem 5) A function that takes two arrays of numbers and returns the result of merging the arrays. 
The elements of the first array should become the elements at the even indexes of the returned array, 
while the elements of the second array should become the elements at the odd indexes.

## Casual ##
Given two collections of numbers of equal lengths

Initialize empty array
Initialize iterator at 0

Perform loop with a number of iterations equal to the length of the given arrays
  Append value of Array One at position iterator to the empty array
  Append value of Array two at position iterator to the empty array
  Ingrement iterator

return empty array

## Formal ##
GET arrayOne
GET arrayTwo
SET output = empty array
SET iterator = 0

WHILE interator < length of arrayOne
  Append value of arrayOne at position iterator to output
  Append value of arrayTwo at position iterator to output
  iterator++

RETURN output
